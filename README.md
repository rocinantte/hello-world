# hello-world


Hi ppl,
It's me, your friendly neighborhood Martí and this is just a test. Some of my interests are read, chill on the sofa and learning new things. My major interest is artificial intelligence, although i don't know anything about it lel. I don't have a favorite programming language, but i would like to learn more about Python.

PD: Don't blame my english skills, i'm doing my best.
